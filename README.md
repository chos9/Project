Elliptic Curve Cryptography
---------------------------

My current goal is to implement elliptic curve cryptography using very minimal library in sage. 
Specifically, I will first try to implement Elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman which will be managable as we have 
already learned Diffie-Hellman public key cryptosystem. I may try to implement other kinds as I study more about 
elliptic curve.
